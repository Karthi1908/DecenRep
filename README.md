## How it works:
Users can add social media posts to the Decenrep and the posts will be rated for facts, fake news, hate messages, sarcasm, bot activity, and political side by the members of Decenrep DAO. Once the rating is completed, it can be used to rate the Influencer who posted the SM message.
